# 🌟 Neha's Daily Study Journal

Welcome to my personal learning tracker and coding portfolio! This repository documents my **daily progress** as I work on improving my skills in:

- 🧮 **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** – for problem-solving and interviews
- 📊 **SQL** – for database querying and analysis
- ⚙️ **Mini Projects** – for hands-on practice with new libraries and real-world concepts
- 📝 **Daily Logs** – for self-reflection and consistency

This repository is both a **public accountability journal** and a **curated showcase of my growth as a developer**.

## 📊 How to Navigate

- **New to this repo?**
  Start with [`progress_tracker.md`](./progress_tracker.md) to see my roadmap and what I’m currently working on.

- **Interested in my DSA work?**
  Browse the [`DSA/`](./DSA/) folder organized by topics (Arrays, Trees, Graphs, etc.). Each file includes:
  - Problem link
  - My solution
  - Time/space complexity
  - Personal notes or edge cases

- **SQL Enthusiast?**
  Check out the [`SQL/`](./SQL/) folder for my study plan progress, including query explanations and insights into tricky clauses.

- **Want to see practical skills?**
  Jump into the [`Projects/`](./Projects/) folder where I experiment with real-world problems using tools like:
  - Pandas
  - PySpark
  - Streamlit
  - API requests
  - Visualization libraries
  - And more!

---

## 🔁 Daily Logs

Each day, I update a markdown file in the [`Logs/`](./Logs/) folder with:

- ✅ What I solved/built today
- 💡 Key insights or new concepts
- ❗ Challenges I faced
- 📅 Plan for tomorrow

Example: [`2025-06-15.md`](./Logs/2025-06-15.md)

## 💡 Why I'm Doing This

I believe in the power of **consistency over intensity**. By showing up every day—even if it’s just solving one problem, reading one page, or pushing one commit—I aim to build:

- Better problem-solving skills
- Deeper understanding of CS fundamentals
- Real-world coding fluency
- A growth mindset and learning habit

This also serves as a **public, verifiable portfolio** for recruiters, collaborators, and mentors.
